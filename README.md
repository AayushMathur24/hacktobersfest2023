# Hacktoberfest 2023 Repository

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest 2023 repository! We're excited to have you here and encourage your contributions to this open-source project. Please take a moment to read through the guidelines and get started.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source projects, their maintainers, and the entire community of contributors. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests on GitHub.

To participate, all you need to do is make four pull requests to open-source repositories on GitHub. You can learn more and sign up on the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
